                <div class="child-2-inner-2-header">How It All Began</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">Founded by Andy Koh in 2008, PetFinder.my has been working hard with
                    nationwide animal shelters, rescuers, and pet lovers to improve Malaysia's animal welfare. Much of
                    our focus was centered upon pets — specifically, dogs and cats (alright, we have rabbits, hamsters,
                    birds, fishes, turtles and chickens too).</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">However, there exists a very real burden for all people involved in
                    animal welfare: the challenging demand of their time, effort and money. It is no easy task being a
                    rescuer, and only a tiny fraction of animal lovers are able to be actively involved in such onerous
                    tasks. How do we widen the circle of people in animal welfare, and make it so attractive and simple
                    that anyone can participate?</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">Thus, the concept of KindMeal was born. A platform for anyone,
                    irregardless of age, gender or financial status, to save lives anywhere, anytime. Without requiring
                    any effort, time or money. In fact, they can even SAVE money. Sounds too good to be true, eh? Don't
                    worry, this is not a pyramid scheme.</div>

                <div class="child-2-inner-2-header">Saving Lives With Delicious Meals</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">How does eating food help save animal lives? Isn't food consumption
                    just for saving our own lives?</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">Actually, the concept is really simple. Unless you are a vegetarian
                    or vegan (which we salute you for), most of us are taking the lives of animals every single day.
                    These animals — be it chickens, cows, lambs, ducks, pigs or fishes, are equally precious lives, and
                    deserve our kindness and compassion as much as our beloved pets.
                </div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">They experience joy, pain, hunger, love and sadness similar to us.
                    Just because we are not able to communicate well with them, make them fetch a ball or keep them as
                    pets in our homes, we tend to neglect their well-being and shift our focus to the so-called
                    delicious taste of their meat.</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">We understand that it may not be easy to become a full vegetarian,
                    but we strongly believe that it is feasible and achievable for all of us to reduce meat consumption,
                    be it for compassion, health or environmental reasons. If we eat a couple of meat-free meals a week,
                    it effectively means that we would be consistently saving the lives of many animals each month which
                    would otherwise have ended up in our bellies.
                </div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">We have been accustomed to delicacies and cuisines made of meat, but
                    it need not remain so. There exists a wide variety of meat-free food that are delicious and
                    nutritious, and more often than not, cost less than similar meals with meat.</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">So, how do we get started?</div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-header">The KindMeal Vision</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">To promote this concept, our team worked round the clock for months
                    and months (we forgot what the sun looks like) to introduce a unique and exciting platform to
                    promote meat-free dining.</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">It is not sufficient to just tell people the benefits of meat-free
                    dining. We have to give them good, practical reasons for trying it out, and it has to be simple,
                    effective, and of course, enjoyable.
                </div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">KindMeal attempts this by closely working with restaurants and cafes
                    to offer attractive meat-free deals and cozy dining environments. Everyone loves good food and great
                    bargains!</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">The restaurants need not be strictly vegetarian, as long as the deals
                    and food they promote on KindMeal are meat-free. We want food lovers to be able to enjoy meat-free
                    meals conveniently, including at their existing favorite restaurants.</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">Our platform offers a structured, effective way for restaurants to
                    promote themselves, with a proper showcase of their shop, menu, deals and outlets. Getting and using
                    deal coupons are extremely simple, it only takes ONE single click — no online payment, advance
                    planning, coupon printing or reservation required. Even your pet can do it. Eating is all about
                    spontaneity, right?</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">The KindWords and KindMoment features are carefully crafted to
                    encourage viral promotion of restaurants and the meat-free dining experience, creatively leveraging
                    on social media to strengthen the cause. Consumers can DOUBLE their deal discounts by sharing it on
                    social media, and camwhore with the delicious food to show their friends (Malaysians LOVE taking
                    photos of their food, perhaps even more than eating it).</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">
                    Ultimately, it is a cycle of supply and demand. The more food lovers that try out such meals, the
                    more encouraged restaurants are in introducing creative meat-free menu items, which would in turn
                    attract more people into compassionate dining.
                </div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">This will not happen overnight, but we have to start somewhere and
                    help it materialize.

                <div class="child-2-inner-2-header">Of Factory Farming & Global Warming</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">60 billion farm animals are slaughtered each year for our pleasure.
                    Factoring in marine lives, it reaches a whopping 2 TRILLION each year.</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">Most of us are aware of the issues brought forth by such widespread
                    consumption. Inhumane farm conditions where animals live perpetually in dirty, packed and tortorous
                    environments before being carelessly slaughtered. Animals are force-fed to introduce more fats in
                    them, pre-emptively given antibiotics to keep them alive, incapacitated to prevent them from
                    accidentally harming each other in overpacked environments — these are but a few examples of their
                    voiceless sufferings, unfortunate lives that are bred to be killed, to satisfy the whims and fancies
                    of us civilized humans.</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">We are experiencing global food shortage because so much of the
                    agriculture land is used for planting animal feed. If such lands were used for feeding humans,
                    bypassing the animal food chain, it would be so much more efficient, with lower food prices and much
                    less blood on our hands.</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">Did you know that the biggest contributor of global warming is the
                    gas emitted by cows? Yes, they fart. A lot. A single cow releases as much greenhouse gases as a car
                    driving 12,000km per year. Now multiply that by 1,500,000,000 cows.</div>
                <div class="child-2-inner-2-para ">There is a wealth of resources and literature out there on why we
                    should reduce meat consumption, so we won't delve into it in detail. But you get the drift.</div>
