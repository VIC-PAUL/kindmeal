                    ingredients derived from meat. However, it may contain some elements that people of certain diet do
                    not consume, such as eggs, dairy / milk, or alcohol. Please refer to the details within each
                    specific shop / deal for further information.</div>

                    make any upfront payment at KindMeal, and you can easily present our LiveCoupon via computer, mobile
